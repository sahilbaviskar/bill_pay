    {
      "person": "Shantanu",
      "totalPaid": 1100.00,
      "totalOwed": 710.00,
      "balance": 390.00
    },
    {
      "person": "Sanket",
      "totalPaid": 730.00,
      "totalOwed": 710.00,
      "balance": 20.00
    },
    {
      "person": "Om",
      "totalPaid": 300.00,
      "totalOwed": 710.00,
      "balance": -410.00
    }
  ],
  "message": "Balances calculated successfully"
}
```

#### Get Settlements
```http
GET /settlements
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "from": "Om",
      "to": "Shantanu",
      "amount": 390.00
    },
    {
      "from": "Om",
      "to": "Sanket",
      "amount": 20.00
    }
  ],
  "message": "Settlements calculated successfully"
}
```

## Settlement Calculation Logic

The settlement algorithm works as follows:

1. **Calculate Individual Balances**: For each person, calculate `totalPaid - totalOwed`
2. **Identify Creditors and Debtors**: 
   - Positive balance = creditor (should receive money)
   - Negative balance = debtor (should pay money)
3. **Minimize Transactions**: Use a greedy algorithm to minimize the number of settlement transactions
4. **Generate Optimal Settlements**: Create the minimum number of transactions needed to settle all debts

### Example Calculation

Given expenses:
- Shantanu paid ‚Çπ1100, owes ‚Çπ710 ‚Üí Balance: +‚Çπ390 (creditor)
- Sanket paid ‚Çπ730, owes ‚Çπ710 ‚Üí Balance: +‚Çπ20 (creditor)  
- Om paid ‚Çπ300, owes ‚Çπ710 ‚Üí Balance: -‚Çπ410 (debtor)

Optimal settlement:
- Om pays ‚Çπ390 to Shantanu
- Om pays ‚Çπ20 to Sanket
- Total: 2 transactions instead of potentially 6

## Data Validation

### Input Validation Rules
- **Amount**: Must be positive, max 2 decimal places
- **Description**: Required, max 255 characters
- **Paid By**: Required, only letters and spaces
- **Share Type**: EQUAL, PERCENTAGE, or EXACT_AMOUNT
- **Percentage Shares**: Must sum to 100%
- **Exact Amount Shares**: Must sum to total expense amount

### Error Handling
- Proper HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500)
- Descriptive error messages
- Validation error details
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## Sample Data

The application comes pre-populated with sample data:

**People**: Shantanu, Sanket, Om

**Sample Expenses**:
1. Dinner at restaurant - ‚Çπ600 (paid by Shantanu)
2. Groceries for the week - ‚Çπ450 (paid by Sanket)  
3. Petrol for road trip - ‚Çπ300 (paid by Om)
4. Movie tickets - ‚Çπ500 (paid by Shantanu)
5. Pizza delivery - ‚Çπ280 (paid by Sanket)

## Testing

### Using Postman
1. Import the provided Postman collection
2. Set the base URL to your deployed API or `http://localhost:8080`
3. Run the pre-configured requests to test all endpoints

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Get all expenses
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/expenses

# Add new expense
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/expenses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount":100.00,"description":"Test expense","paidBy":"John","involvedPeople":["John","Jane"]}'

# Get balances
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/balances

# Get settlements
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/settlements
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Currency**: Currently handles only one currency (assumes INR)
2. **Precision**: Uses BigDecimal with 2 decimal places for money calculations
3. **Concurrency**: No optimistic locking for concurrent updates
4. **Authentication**: No user authentication/authorization implemented
5. **Audit Trail**: No tracking of who made changes to expenses

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] User authentication and authorization
- [ ] Expense categories and tags
- [ ] Recurring expenses
- [ ] File attachments (receipts)
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Mobile app integration
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
